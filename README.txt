| It is recommended to play in fullscreen with neon graphics, 60 fps and |
| default difficulty for a good playing experience. (On Windows hide the |
| taskbar if possible, if not try to change to a darker theme to see the |
| neon colors and ui properly)                                           |
|                                                                        |

| The red (evil) twin can shoot but takes damage a lot                   |
| The green twin can't shoot but has a shield and regenerates health     |
| The green twin can destroy shapes by the front point (of the triangle) |
|                                                                        |
| Destroying shapes increases the score and fills the Meter.             |
| If the Meter is full you can switch to the other twin, doing this will |
| deplete the Meter.                                                     |
|                                                                        |

| The number on the top is your score. The number in the bottom left     |

| The meter/bar at the bottom is the Meter (see RULES), when it covers   |
| the entire screen you can switch to the other twin.                    |

| In a mad experiment your evil twin has tried to take control of you!   |
| It fails, combining both of you into a triangle.                       |
| Your twin's evil allies don't recognize your twin as a triangle and    |
| attack what seems to be an intruder...                                 |

| If you want to modify the source code, try these:                      |
| 1. Create a new enemy type                                             |
| 2. Add some AI or movement to the triangles or squares                 |
| 3. Multiplayer                                                         |
|                                                                        |
